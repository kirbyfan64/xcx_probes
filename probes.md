##Original introduction
This guide aims to list the location of every probe in Xenoblade Chronicles X for Wii U. The list is compiled in such a way that 1) it can be used by players who just started a (new) save file, and 2) it can be used by players with pre-existing save files to check their own probe count and locate any probes they may have missed. This project originally started as a way for me to keep track of the probes I had found on my third playthrough, so that, in the event a guide like this one was published before I managed to find every probe, I could easily cross reference my list with theirs to find my missing probes. However, as my list grew, and my hopes of such a guide being published any time soon faded (I have been unable to find one online anywhere), I decided I might as well publish my own list, in the hopes it can be of aid to others. At the time of writing this introduction I have found only 183 out of the 188 probes that (supposedly) exist within this game. The reason for publishing this guide prematurely is simply because it might be a while before I find the remaining probes (I am still in between chapters 8 and 9), and this guide might be of help to people in the meantime. 

Nearly every probe in this list has been found prior to acquiring the flight module, meaning it is never too early to start hunting probes. Though most probes do not strictly require the flight module to find, there are some which were (presumably) intended to be found <strong>after</strong> obtaining the flight module. However, these locations can often also be reached through <em>mountaingoating</em>, by which I mean climbing tall structures by jumping in your skell, getting vertical boosts while driving in your skell, and performing long jumps. Those unfamiliar with boosts and longjumps are advised to have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0yGNcLq5sYjqfoV0daOub5QLE_WHOIO4">Ze1dahead</a>’s youtube channel. He/She has made a number of videos where he/she climbs structures that were (presumably) meant to be scaled with the flight module without the flight module. The videos are interesting to watch, and scaling the largest structures yourself before obtaining the flight module will give you a great feeling of satisfaction.

#Notes <a name="notes"></a>
- N means north, S  means south, etc.
- When I say “(completes)” I mean that opening that treasure completes the segment (i.e. a golden shield icon appears). This should make it easy for players with preexisting save files to look up which probes they might have missed. These treasures generally have a less-detailed description, because 1)they are easy to find anyway, and 2) I expect most readers to have found those treasures already.
-  “Level” denotes the required level of your mechanical field skill in order to open the treasure. <strong>No probe is contained in a biological or archaeological treasure</strong>.
- I have tried to order the list in a sensible way. That is, I have tried to order them based on 1) proximity to other probes, and 2) difficulty of reaching it. I accept suggestions for reordering.
- After checking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/40tsow/final_probe_amountscount_162k_storage202k/">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/701151-xenoblade-chronicles-x">GameFAQs</a> extensively it seems that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/40tsow/final_probe_amountscount_162k_storage202k/">the numbers</a> <a href="/u/Suffuri">/u/Suffuri</a> listed as being the maximum number of probes are indeed correct.
- For reasons I will not go into I have decided not to take screenshots. However, I will gladly accept and add screenshots from readers.
- ~Since I have not yet located every probe I would also love to hear it if you know where to find the last ones. On this playthrough I am in between chapters 8 and 9, and I do not plan on clearing chapter 9 for a while. Therefore I do not have (easy) access to places that require the flight pack, or the Ganglion Antropolis. I expect to find some probes in these places.~ <em>Every probe has been found!</em>
- I would love to hear any and all kinds of feedback and corrections. Please post them below instead of PMing me, so that others can also join in on the conversation if they wish to.
- ~I plan to update this guide/list as soon as I obtain a new probe. Stay tuned.~ <em>Every probe has been found!</em>

#Version History <a name="history"></a>
- <p>Version 2.0: Electric Boogaloo – 24-09-2016
I changed the order of the Mining G3 probes. <em>Every probe has been found and listed!</em></p>
- <p>Version 1.1 – 24-09-2016
I changed the order of the Fuel Recovery and Ranged Attack probes. 187/188 probes listed.</p>
- <p>Version 1.0 – 23-09-2016
Initial version, 183/188 probes listed.</p>
